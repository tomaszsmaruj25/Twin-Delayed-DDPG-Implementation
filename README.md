# Twin-Delayed-DDPG-Implementation
A project made on the basis of a course on the Udemy platform  https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning/
The entire project was made in google Collab.

## Main idea
The aim of the project was to propose a control based on gain learning algorithms. I decided to implement an architecture that is an extension of the DDPG (Deep Deterministic Gradient Descent) algorithm, i.e. an architecture with an actor and a critic. 
The new architecture is called Twin-Delayed DDPG (TD3). Link to the article: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09477.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09477.pdf).
